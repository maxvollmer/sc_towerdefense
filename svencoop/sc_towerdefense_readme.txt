Sven Co-op: Towerdefense - Map by Max 'Protector' Vollmer (Beta)

This map is a 2player-cooperative map. You have to create at least 12 slots on a server to avoid crashes. I recommend using 24 or more slots.

You have to build towers to stop creatures from escaping.

Controls are as follows:
move for, back: select towerpad
move right, left: select tower
jump: build tower
fire: give 1 credit to other player
use: toggle camera

Please note that this map is only in beta-status. Report any bug to Protector or any other MoN-responsible.

This map belongs to MoN.
