Evile Dick's Valve rock conversion.WAD V1.0 1999

This wad contains the main Valve rock, gravel, and path textures, recoloured to green, blue, yellow and grey.
They are intended either as a change from the normal Valve red rock textures, or to assis in marking out team areas for TFC maps.

If you do like them and use them, please mention me in your readme or include this text file with your distribution .ZIP. If I know that my work is appreciated I'm far more likely to do more stuff.
