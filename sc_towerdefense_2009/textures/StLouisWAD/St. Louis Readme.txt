St. Louis  Texture wad by Locknut

Some nice brick building textures for your city type maps.
Feel free to use them in any FREE Half-Life Project.
If you do use them in your map, drop me a line so I can check it out.

If you want to use them in a commercial project, get in touch with me and we can work out a deal.
